# solhunt-duel

Autonomous Red-vs-Blue adversarial agents for smart contract security. Red finds and exploits vulnerabilities; Blue hardens the contract and re-runs Red to verify the patch holds. Full convergence, no human in the loop.

Give it a contract address and solhunt-duel will: fork mainnet, read the source, write a working Solidity exploit, execute it, then (Blue) patch the contract, re-deploy the patched version, and re-run the Red attack against the patched artifact. If Red still wins, Blue iterates. Full audit report at the end.

**Live progress:** https://solhunt-duel.netlify.app (placeholder — the Phase 3 UI deploy is in flight)

Below: the original solhunt numbers (Red-only baseline) plus the new **Duel results** from the first end-to-end convergence run.

## Benchmark Results

### Phase 1: Original Sonnet baseline (curated 32-contract set)

Original 32-contract baseline from curated DeFiHackLabs set.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Exploit rate** | **67.7%** (21/31 contracts) |
| **Avg cost per contract** | $0.89 |
| **Total benchmark cost** | $28.64 |
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet 4 (via OpenRouter) |

1 contract (Conic Finance) failed due to an Etherscan API edge case and was excluded from results.

For reference, [Anthropic's research team (SCONE-bench)](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/smart-contracts/) reported a 51.1% success rate on the same class of task.

### Results by Vulnerability Class

### Phase 3: Expanded multi-model benchmark (April 2026)

After expanding the dataset to 95 contracts via [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs) import, ran a multi-model benchmark on Claude Sonnet 4 + Qwen3.5-35B-A3B.

**Key finding: detection rate drops significantly on a non-curated dataset.** The original 32-contract benchmark was implicitly cherry-picked for contracts with good source code and clear attack vectors. A random sample from DeFiHackLabs includes:
- Unverified contracts (no source available on Etherscan)
- Multi-protocol exploits requiring cross-contract orchestration
- BSC/Arbitrum contracts mislabeled in the import
- Complex proxy patterns beyond current sandbox capability

**Qwen3.5-35B-A3B pre-flight (47 scans ran to completion):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Validated exploits | **6 (12.8%)** |
| Total cost | $7.76 |
| Cost per validated exploit | $1.29 |

All 6 Qwen wins were access-control or simple reentrancy at $0.07-$0.15 each. Qwen does not currently handle complex proxy or flash-loan exploits.

**Sonnet targeted (6 scans on Qwen-failed candidates):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Validated exploits | **1 (DFX Finance reentrancy)** |
| Cost for the win | $3.25 |
| Cost for 5 failures | $6.05 |

The 5 Sonnet failures were contracts requiring multi-protocol flash loans and non-standard token balance manipulation. Our sandbox doesn't currently expose cheatcodes for those.

**Honest assessment:** The 67.7% rate on the curated set doesn't generalize. On a random sample, detection drops to ~13%. The curated number reflects "what this agent CAN do when the contract is approachable." The expanded number reflects "what it does against arbitrary exploits."

Both are honest. Different questions.

## Duel results (Phase 2 centerpiece)

First end-to-end Red-vs-Blue convergence. Run ID: `16af8d22-1b78-48e8-acf6-e720bfa05e12`. Target: Dexible access-control exploit.

| Round | Agent | Wall time | Turns | Notional moved | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Red | 41.8s | 8 | $0.25 | autonomous pivot to proxy-takeover; exploit passed |
| R1 | Blue | 551s (9m11s) | 80 | $3.78 | **all 4 gates green** (compiles, tests pass, Red fails, no regressions) |
| R2 | Red | 277s (4m37s) | 23 | $1.24 | honest "nothing found" against Blue's patch |

**Convergence:** hardened. Total wall time 17.6 min. Total notional $5.27. **Real API bill: $0** (Max subscription via `claude -p` subprocess).

Red pivoted on its own in R1 from the obvious access-control surface to a proxy-takeover path — no prompt engineering, it just read the code and chose. Blue's 80-turn defense was verbose but all four verification gates hit green. Most important: R2 Red ran the same attack loop against the patched contract and came back empty-handed without hallucinating a false positive. That's the trust test the duel exists to answer.

## How It Works

### The Agent Loop

The core loop (`src/agent/loop.ts`) orchestrates the full scan:

1. **Pre-scan recon** queries the forked chain before the agent starts, gathering ETH balance, code size, owner address, token info (name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply), DEX pair data (token0, token1, reserves), storage slot 0, and EIP-1967 proxy implementation address. All 13 queries run in parallel with 10s timeouts. This saves 3-5 iterations the agent would waste on discovery.

2. **Source injection.** The analysis prompt includes up to 30KB of contract source code inline (not behind a tool call), so the agent starts reasoning about vulnerabilities immediately. For larger contracts, the first file is included in full and remaining files are summarized with signatures only.

3. **Agent iteration.** The agent calls tools (bash, text editor, forge_test) to analyze and exploit the contract. Each tool call executes inside an isolated Docker container via `docker exec`. The agent sees tool output, decides its next action, and iterates. Max 30 iterations, 1 hour timeout.

4. **Report extraction.** When the agent wraps its findings in `===SOLHUNT_REPORT_START===` / `===SOLHUNT_REPORT_END===` markers, the loop breaks immediately and parses the structured JSON.

### Smart Recovery

The agent loop has several mechanisms to prevent wasted iterations:

**Context-aware nudges.** When the model stops calling tools without producing a report, the loop checks what stage the agent is at and sends a targeted nudge:
- No code read yet: "list files and read the main contract"
- Code read but no exploit written: "stop reading, write the exploit NOW"
- Forge test failed: "read the error, rewrite Exploit.t.sol"
- Forge test passed: "output your structured report"

**Loop detection.** If the model calls `forge_test` 3+ times in a row without editing code between calls, the loop forces a full rewrite with a different approach.

**Iteration budget enforcement.** If the agent spends 8+ iterations reading files and running `cast` queries without writing any exploit code, it gets a hard warning to write the test immediately.

**Forced report extraction.** In the last 3 iterations, the loop forces the agent to output its findings in structured format. This handles models like Claude that only return tool_use blocks and never produce text output on their own.

**Conversation trimming.** When the conversation exceeds 10 messages, older tool outputs are truncated to 200 characters. System prompt + analysis prompt + last 6 messages are always kept in full. Very long tool outputs (>50KB) are truncated to first + last 25KB.

**Circuit breaker.** During benchmarks, if 3 consecutive contracts produce no report or hit the same error, the benchmark stops immediately to avoid wasting budget.

### Sandbox Isolation

Each scan runs in its own Docker container built from `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest`:

- **Pre-cached DeFi dependencies:** OpenZeppelin, Uniswap V2/V3 core, and Chainlink are pre-installed in the Docker image. Each scan copies from `/workspace/template` to `/workspace/scan`, avoiding `forge init` overhead.
- **Resource limits:** 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 512MB tmpfs
- **Security:** `no-new-privileges` flag, bridge-only networking (no host network access)
- **Lifecycle:** container created at scan start, destroyed after (pass or fail)
- **Remappings:** `@openzeppelin`, `@uniswap/v2-core`, `@uniswap/v3-core`, `@chainlink` are pre-configured in `foundry.toml`

The agent writes and executes arbitrary Solidity inside this sandbox. It cannot escape to the host.

### Exploit Strategy

The system prompt (`prompts/system.md`) instructs the agent to use **interface-only imports** instead of importing source files directly. Real DeFi contracts use older Solidity versions (0.6.x, 0.7.x) that conflict with forge-std (0.8.x). The agent defines minimal interfaces for only the functions it needs, then targets the real contract at its on-chain address on the fork.

The agent knows these vulnerability classes:
- **Reentrancy** ... external calls before state updates, callback re-entry
- **Access control** ... missing authorization, proxy/delegatecall bypass, re-initialization
- **Price/oracle manipulation** ... spot price from DEX pool, flash-borrow to skew reserves
- **Flash loan attacks** ... borrow to manipulate governance, collateral ratios, pool prices
- **Logic errors** ... incorrect math, wrong comparison, missing checks, call ordering
- **Integer overflow/underflow** ... pre-Solidity 0.8 unchecked arithmetic
- **Unchecked return values** ... ignored `.send()` / `.call()` failures
- **Delegatecall abuse** ... unprotected delegatecall, storage collision

### Multi-Provider Support

Works with any OpenAI-compatible API:

| Provider | Model | Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | claude-sonnet-4 | ~$0.89/scan | Best benchmark results (67.7%) |
| **Anthropic** | claude-sonnet-4-6 | ~$0.89/scan | Direct API |
| **OpenAI** | gpt-4o | ~$1.20/scan | Fast, good tool use |
| **Ollama** (default) | qwen2.5-coder:32b | Free | Local inference, no API key needed |
| **Ollama** | qwen3.5:27b | Free | Requires 16GB+ RAM |

Additional Ollama presets: `ollama-small` (qwen2.5-coder:7b), `ollama-llama` (llama3.1:8b), `ollama-32b` (qwen2.5-coder:32b-8k), `ollama-qwen35` (qwen3.5:27b).

The provider layer handles all format conversion between OpenAI and Anthropic message formats:
- Anthropic requires strict user/assistant turn alternation. The provider merges consecutive same-role messages automatically.
- Anthropic assistant messages can contain both text and tool_use blocks. The provider preserves text content that other adapters drop.
- Local models sometimes return tool calls as JSON text instead of structured `tool_calls`. The provider includes a multi-strategy JSON extractor that handles markdown code blocks, trailing garbage tokens, brace-matching with depth tracking, and raw content parsing.
- Node.js `fetch` has a 5-minute default `headersTimeout` via undici. Local models on CPU can take 5-9 minutes per response. solhunt overrides this globally to 10 minutes.
- Qwen 3.5 has a reasoning mode that adds 2-3 minutes per call on CPU. solhunt appends `/no_think` to disable it.

## Setup

### Requirements

- **Node.js 20+**
- **Docker** (running)
- **Ethereum RPC endpoint** (Alchemy free tier works)
- **Etherscan API key** (free, for fetching contract source)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/claygeo/solhunt.git
cd solhunt
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
# Required
ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

# Provider (pick one)
SOLHUNT_PROVIDER=openrouter              # best benchmark results
# SOLHUNT_PROVIDER=ollama                # free, local
# SOLHUNT_PROVIDER=anthropic             # direct Anthropic API
# SOLHUNT_PROVIDER=openai                # OpenAI

# API key for your chosen provider
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional tuning
# SOLHUNT_MAX_ITERATIONS=30             # max agent iterations per contract
# SOLHUNT_TOOL_TIMEOUT=60000            # per-tool timeout (ms)
# SOLHUNT_SCAN_TIMEOUT=1800000          # total scan timeout (ms, default 30 min)
```

### Build the Docker Sandbox

```bash
docker build -t solhunt-sandbox .
```

Builds from `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest` with pre-installed DeFi dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Uniswap V2/V3, Chainlink). ~2 minutes first build, cached after.

## Usage

### Reproduce the Dexible duel

```bash
# Make sure .env has ETH_RPC_URL, ETHERSCAN_API_KEY, and SOLHUNT_PROVIDER=claude-cli (Max subscription)
npx tsx src/index.ts duel 0x24F58C49066a5bC3358Ee5075deE00B6Db5C9e40 \
  --chain ethereum \
  --block 17968639 \
  --run-id 16af8d22-1b78-48e8-acf6-e720bfa05e12
```

That regenerates the R1 Red → R1 Blue → R2 Red cycle end to end. With the Max subscription provider the API bill is $0. Expect ~17-18 minutes wall time.

### Scan a contract

```bash
# By address (fetches source from Etherscan, forks at specific block)
npx tsx src/index.ts scan 0x1234...abcd --chain ethereum --block 19000000

# Local Solidity file
npx tsx src/index.ts scan ./contracts/Vault.sol

# Different provider/model
npx tsx src/index.ts scan 0x1234... --provider openrouter --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

# Dry run (preview config, no API calls)
npx tsx src/index.ts scan 0x1234... --dry-run

# JSON output
npx tsx src/index.ts scan 0x1234... --json
```

### Run the benchmark

```bash
# Full dataset (32 contracts)
npx tsx src/index.ts benchmark --dataset ./benchmark/dataset.json

# Limit + save results
npx tsx src/index.ts benchmark --limit 10 --output results.json

# Adjust concurrency (parallel scans)
npx tsx src/index.ts benchmark --concurrency 3
```

The benchmark runner uses `Promise.allSettled()` to isolate failures, saves intermediate results after each batch, and includes a circuit breaker that halts if 3 consecutive contracts fail the same way.

### Health check

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts health
```

Verifies Docker is running, provider is configured, API keys are set, RPC endpoint is reachable.

## Output Format

Each scan produces a structured `ExploitReport`:

```json
{
  "contract": "0xC1E088fC1323b20BCBee9bd1B9fC9546db5624C5",
  "contractName": "Beanstalk",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "blockNumber": 14595904,
  "found": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "class": "flash-loan",
    "severity": "critical",
    "functions": ["propose", "vote", "emergencyCommit"],
    "description": "Governance flash-loan attack. Attacker used flash loan to gain voting power..."
  },
  "exploit": {
    "script": "test/Exploit.t.sol",
    "executed": true,
    "output": "forge test output...",
    "valueAtRisk": "~$181M"
  }
}
```

The `ScanResult` wrapper adds iteration count, token usage, USD cost, and duration.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # All tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:e2e      # E2E (requires Docker)
npm run lint          # Type check
```

## Deployment

Designed to run on a Linux VPS with Docker.

```bash
ssh your-vps
git clone https://github.com/claygeo/solhunt.git
cd solhunt
npm install
docker build -t solhunt-sandbox .
cp .env.example .env    # fill in keys
npx tsx src/index.ts health
npx tsx src/index.ts scan 0x1234...
```

Recommended: 4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM, 20GB disk. For local inference with Ollama, 16 cores and 32GB RAM for reasonable response times.

## Supported Chains

The dataset loader supports chain IDs for: Ethereum (1), BSC (56), Polygon (137), Arbitrum (42161), Optimism (10), Avalanche (43114), and Base (8453). The current benchmark dataset uses Ethereum mainnet only, but the infrastructure works with any EVM chain that has an Etherscan-compatible API and RPC endpoint.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript + Node.js** ... CLI and agent orchestration
- **Foundry** (forge, anvil, cast) ... Solidity compilation, testing, blockchain forking
- **Docker + dockerode** ... sandbox isolation for arbitrary code execution
- **Etherscan API v2** ... verified contract source retrieval
- **commander** ... CLI parsing
- **chalk + ora** ... terminal output
